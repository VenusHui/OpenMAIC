/**
 * Owner-level extraction state for library sources (RFC #1716 §2–3).
 *
 * The session chain (`@openmaic/storage/material/pg`) keeps queueing, leases
 * and results on each conversation's copy of a material, so a second
 * conversation extracts the same upload again. This module keeps them on the
 * owner's `owner_material` row instead, so every conversation shares one
 * extraction of one source.
 *
 * Nothing in production calls this module yet: no runner claims from it and
 * no route or tool starts it. Its results are read by nothing until the
 * Phase 2 readers land, and RFC #1716 does not publish new extraction output
 * before then.
 *
 * ## State
 *
 * The status lives where the public view already shows it, in the
 * `extraction` JSONB (`{ status }`): idle, pending, running, done or failed.
 * The rest is private (`./owner-materials.ts` lists the columns):
 *
 * - `extraction_token`: the current claim. Every claim mints a fresh one and
 *   every write of a claim names it, so a worker whose lease was taken over,
 *   or that comes back after a manual restart, writes nothing -- even when
 *   the same process claims the source again.
 * - `extraction_claims`: claims since the last explicit start. Each claim,
 *   a takeover of an expired lease included, spends one; a source whose
 *   lease keeps expiring fails once the budget is spent instead of being
 *   claimed forever.
 * - `extraction_result`: the latest successful extraction, written in the
 *   same statement that sets `done`, so `done` without a result cannot be
 *   stored. Its `revision` is the token of the claim that published it.
 *
 * What a claim guarantees is bounded: a finite number of claims and no late
 * write. It does not bound how long one claim runs -- a provider that never
 * returns while its heartbeat keeps the lease alive stays running.
 *
 * ## Publishing
 *
 * {@link publishOwnerMaterialExtraction} commits the result in one
 * transaction: the owner's write fence (forwarded, so a run that started
 * before a claim of its owner publishes for the account it moved to), the
 * material rows in one ascending lock, the claim check, one reference-root
 * call for every asset the result keeps, the derivative rows and the source
 * row. A check that fails writes nothing at all. The assets are allocated
 * beforehand, each in its own transaction ({@link checkOwnerExtractionClaim}),
 * and an allocation that is never published expires like any other pending
 * entry; nothing here deletes an entry or a byte.
 *
 * ## Deletion
 *
 * Every write here checks `deleted_at`: a deleted source is not claimed, and
 * a claim of one cannot heartbeat, settle or publish. Deleting a material --
 * marking it, cancelling its work and withdrawing its roots together -- is
 * the library operation's job (Phase 2), not this module's.
