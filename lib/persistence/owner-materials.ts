/**
 * Owner-scoped material library — the server-side half of `POST /api/materials`
 * (the reference's `lib/server/materials/store.ts`, ported onto this branch's
 * server provider with raw SQL, the same pattern as `stage-meta.ts`).
 *
 * The workbench's material uploader (`uploadWorkbenchMaterial`) is owner-
 * scoped: it posts a file with no session id and expects a flat 201 view. The
 * branch's agent-session materials stay session-scoped (the agent tools' list
 * surface); this table is the owner's durable library that the uploader feeds.
 *
 * An upload's bytes live in the asset pool, under the owner's own partition:
 * the row's `asset_id` points at the entry and a `('material', id)` reference
 * root keeps it alive. Rows from before the pool hold a private object key in
 * the material byte store (`oss_key`) instead, until the backfill moves them;
 * readers take the pool pointer first.
 *
 * ## Upload lifecycle
 *
 * An upload reserves a row with `status = 'uploading'` (quota-checked against
 * the owner's active source materials, `oss_key = ''`), reads its body through
 * a sha256 meter, allocates a pending pool entry for the bytes
 * ({@link allocateOwnerMaterialBytes}), then publishes the pointer, the root
 * and `'ready'` in one transaction ({@link publishOwnerMaterialUpload}). A
 * failed upload abandons the row and leaves any pending entry to expire; a
 * process death leaves `uploading` rows behind, which the next upload's 24-hour
 * reclaim removes. Rows reserved before the pool still name an object, which
 * the reclaim deletes first, then the reservation, so a crash mid-reclaim never
 * loses the pointer to the bytes.

 * (`reassignDocumentFolders` in the storage package): a source folder whose
 * normalized name the target already uses is merged into the target's folder;
 * otherwise one whose id the target already uses moves under a fresh id;
 * otherwise it moves unchanged. Every material moves, filed or not --
 * `folder_id IS NULL` is Unfiled and stays Unfiled -- and a filed one follows
 * its folder's mapping.
 *
 * The statement order is what the `ON DELETE RESTRICT` folder foreign key

 * the source folders are deleted only after no material does. Reference roots
 * are keyed by material id, which does not change, so none is touched here.
